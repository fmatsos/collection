# PHP Collection

## Description

Collection is a functional utility library for PHP greater than 7.1.3.

It's similar to [other collection libraries][Other collection libraries] based on regular PHP arrays,
but with a lazy mechanism under the hood that strives to do as little work as possible while being as flexible
as possible.

Functions like [`array_map()`][array_map function], [`array_filter()`][array_filter function] and
[`array_reduce()`][array_reduce function] are great, but they create new arrays and everything is eagerly done before
going to the next step.
Lazy collection leverages PHP's generators, iterators and yield statements to allow you to work with very large data
sets while keeping memory usage as low as possible.

For example, imagine your application needs to process a multi-gigabyte log file while taking advantage of this
library's methods to parse the file.
Instead of reading and storing the entire file into memory at once, this library may be used to keep only a small part
of the file in memory at a given time.

On top of this, this library:
 * is [immutable][immutable on wikipedia],
 * is extendable,
 * leverages the power of PHP [generators][php generators] and [iterators][php iterators],
 * uses [S.O.L.I.D. principles][solid on wikipedia],
 * does not have any external dependency,
 * fully tested,
 * type safe (_type safe @ > 95%_),
 * framework agnostic.

Except a few methods, most methods are [pure][pure function on wikipedia] and return a
[new Collection object][collection class].

Also, unlike regular PHP arrays where keys must be either of type `int` or `string`, this collection library let you use
any kind of type for keys: integer, string, objects, arrays, ... anything!
This library could be a valid replacement for [\SplObjectStorage][SplObjectStorage] but with much more features.
This way of working opens up new perspectives and another way of handling data, in a more functional way.

And last but not least, collection keys are preserved throughout most operations, and it might be leading to some
confusions, carefully read [this example][lazy collection example] for the full explanation.

This library has been inspired by:
* [Laravel Support Package][laravel support package]
* [DusanKasan/Knapsack][DusanKasan/Knapsack package]
* [mtdowling/transducers][mtdowling/transducers]
* [Ruby Array][ruby array]
* [Collect.js][collect.js]
* [Rambda][rambda]
* [nikic/iter][nikic/iter package]
* [Haskell][haskell]
* [Lazy.js][lazy.js]

## Features

* **Decoupled**: Each Collection methods is a shortcut to one isolated standard class,
    each operation has its own responsibility. Usually the arguments needed are
    standard PHP variables like `int`, `string`, `callable` or `iterator`.
    It allows users to use those operations individually, at their own will to build
    up something custom. Currently, more than [**80 operations**][collection api] are
    available in this library. This library is basically an example of what you can do with all
    those small bricks, but nothing prevent users to use an operation on its own as well.

* **It takes function first, data-last**: In the following example, multiple operations are created.
    The data to be operated on is generally supplied at last.

    ```php
    <?php

    $data = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];
    $filterCallback = static fn(string $userId): bool => 'foo' !== $userId;

    // Using the Collection library
    $collection = Collection::fromIterable($data)
        ->filter($filterCallback)
        ->reverse();
    print_r($collection->all()); // ['baz', 'bar']

    // Using single operations.
    $filter = Filter::of()($filterCallback);
    $reverse = Reverse::of();
    $pipe = Pipe::of()($reverse, $filter);

    print_r(iterator_to_array($pipe(new ArrayIterator($data))));  // ['baz', 'bar']
    ```

    More information about this in the [Brian Lonsdorf's conference][brian lonsdorf conference], even if
    this is for Javascript, those concepts are common to other programming languages.

    In a nutshell, the combination of currying and function-first enables the developer to compose
    functions with very little code (_often in a “point-free” fashion_), before finally passing in the
    relevant user data.

* **Operations are stateless and curried by default**: This currying makes it easy to
    compose functions to create new functions. Because the API is _function-first_, _data-last_, you can
    continue composing and composing until you build up the function you need before dropping in the data.
    See [this Hugh Jackson article][hugh jackson post] describing the advantages of this style.

    In the following example, the well-known [`flatMap`][flatmap] could be composed of other operations as such:

    ```php
    <?php

    $input = ['foo,bar', 'baz,john'];
    $userData = new ArrayIterator($input);

    $flatMap = static fn (callable $callable) =>
                   Pipe::of()(
                      Map::of()($callable),
                      Flatten::of()(1),
                      Normalize::of()
                   );

    $callback = fn(string $name): array => explode(',', $name);

    print_r(iterator_to_array($flatMap($callback)($userData))); // ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'john']
    ```

## Installation

```composer require loophp/collection```

## Usage

Check out the [usage][collection usage] page, it contains trivial and more advanced use cases.

## Documentation

On top of a complete documented code, the package include a full documentation that gets automatically compiled
and published upon each commit at [https://loophp-collection.rtfd.io][collection documentation site].

[The API][collection api] will give you a pretty good idea of the
existing methods and what you can do with it.

I'm doing my best to keep the documentation up to date, if you found something odd, please let me know in the [issue
queue][collection issue queue].

## Code quality, tests and benchmarks

Every time changes are introduced into the library, [Github][collection actions] run the
tests.

The library has tests written with [PHPSpec][phpspec].
Feel free to check them out in the `spec` directory. Run `composer phpspec` to trigger the tests.

Before each commit some inspections are executed with [GrumPHP][grumphp],
run `composer grumphp` to check manually.

The quality of the tests is tested with [Infection][infection] a PHP Mutation testing
framework,  run `composer infection` to try it.

Static analysers are also controlling the code. [PHPStan][phpstan] and
[PSalm][psalm] are enabled to their maximum level.

[PHP Insights][php insights] is also launched in Github actions just for
information. (_[example of PHP Insights report][php insights report], you must be logged on Github to see it_)

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by sending Github pull requests. I'm quite reactive :-)

If you can't contribute to the code, you can also sponsor me on [Github][github sponsor] or [Paypal][paypal sponsor].
